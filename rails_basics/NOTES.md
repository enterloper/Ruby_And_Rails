# Ruby on Rails
### MVC
Separation of presentation layer (what the user of the application sees in the browser) and the business-logic or back-end.
- Models act as the resources in an app, like User, Post, Article, Stock etc... whatever are the resources consumed in your application. 
- Views make home the frontend of the application 
- Controllers are the brains of the application in order to dictate how the app reacts when a user interfaces with it.
